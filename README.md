# My Carrd-not-a-Carrd!
When I joined Threads, I noticed a lot of people had carrds linked in their bio to display their interests, and I wanted to join in! However, I'd used carrd before and found the restrictions on it quite annoying - I already knew how to make my own websites, so the convenience didn't seem worth it. So, I made this! A small, slightly messy version of a carrd, entirely handmade!
